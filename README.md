# k8s-source

This is an experimental (and currently non-functional) variant of the 
Knative [KubernetesEventSource](https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources). The goal is to explore how much of the effort
of writing a source controller can be eliminated by tools like [metacontroller](https://metacontroller.app/),
[go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger), and
[controller-tools](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools).

See https://github.com/grantr/k8s-source/issues/3 for a friction log.
